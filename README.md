## Coursera: Applied Machine Learning in Python (Kevyn Collins-Thompson)

This repo contains the Jupyter notebooks of the course. I also included the notes and slides presented in the same sequence. In Module 2, there is an extra section that was removed after a couple of weeks when this course was launched on line. The assignment notebooks won't be compleated due to the honour code in coursera. However, the original notebooks will be available as well as the slides in pdf and some of the articles available in pdf given as extra resources.
